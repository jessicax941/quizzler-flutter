# Quizzler ‚ùì

I built on the original quiz app developed as part of the [Flutter Development course](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/flutter-development-bootcamp-with-dart) from [London App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co/).

Original starter project code [here](https://github.com/londonappbrewery/quizzler-flutter)

## Additional features planned
1. Integrate with [this trivia API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) to get T/F questions on computer science topics
2. Add home page
3. Add "Correct"/"Wrong" page/animation that appears after answering a question 
4. Show progress bar/score tracker at the top of the screen
